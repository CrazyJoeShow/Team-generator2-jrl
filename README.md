This app is a Node Command line interface that will take user input data and dynamically creates a roster that will be written to an HTML file.
This touches heavy on Object Oriented Porgramming and Test driven development.

## Installation

To run the app the dependencies will need to installed, they are listed within the Package.json file, simply run npm install in your Commandline to download packages needed for the app to run, once iinstalled navigate to the Develop folder and the app will start with "node app.js" to initialize prompts to take inputs. The input data will then be written to HTML inside of the output folder.
